How to install

  As a standalone application for Windows or MacOS:

	In order for your computer to run our standalone mlSNLO software, you must install the MATLAB Compiler Runtime. The installer executable I linked to above will download and install this runtime software automatically, but it takes a long time to download (as it is many hundreds of megabytes). If you have a connection to the internet which is poor, it might be best to try to download this runtime manually (by selecting the Windows download of R2020a (9.8) from http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html). If you're attempting to install mlSNLO on a computer not connected to the internet, upon request I can make a special installer which includes the runtime, but this makes the mlSNLO installer many hundreds of megabytes.

	In Windows, though the default installation directory is in Program Files, standalone mlSNLO can be installed to any directory you'd like. mlSNLO will store temporary files in a subfolder under your user account (the path is %appdata%\MATLAB SNLO). If you wish to use a do-it-yourself uniaxial or biaxial crystal, use the files ZZ_U.TXT or ZZ_B.TXT located in this directory. You can delete all the files in this directory without harming anything, although you might delete the last form inputs you used.

	A log file called 'mlsnlo.log' containing any errors mlSNLO encounters should be created in the directory from which you launch the shortcut. By default, launching with the desktop shortcut creates this log file on the desktop, though you can change this by modifying the 'Start in' property of mlSNLO's shortcut.

	
  Installed as MATLAB App:

	If you have mlSNLO already installed and you want to install an updated version, you should first uninstall by right clicking the mlSNLO button in the APPS tab and selecting "Uninstall." To install it as an App, you can either right click the MATLAB App installer file (mlSNLO.mlappinstall) in Windows Explorer and select the 'Install' option, or you can click the 'Install App' button on the MATLAB Apps tab and navigate to this file's location, select and open it or double click it. After installation, a mlSNLO shortcut will appear in your MATLAB Apps bar. To launch mlSNLO, change MATLAB's "Current Folder" to the location where you wish to store the temporary files that will be generated by SNLO, then click the 'mlSNLO' button in the Apps tab. The temporary files folder will store the form inputs you last used in a function when you close the function. If you wish to recover those settings the next time you start SNLO, be sure to select the same "Current Folder." If you want to archive the set of form inputs, make a copy of the file "mix.mat" under another name. Change its name back to "mix.mat" to recover the archived inputs.

	If you wish to edit the do-it-yourself crystal files for uniaxial or biaxial crystals (which are "ZZ_U.TXT" and "ZZ_B.TXT" respectively), you can use the command "edit ZZ_U.TXT" or "edit ZZ_B.TXT" in the MATLAB commandline. Alternatively you could use a text editor outside MATLAB to edit them. By default, in Windows, MATLAB will store these files deep in the user's Documents folder, accessible by the command (explorer %userprofile%\Documents\MATLAB\Add-Ons\Apps\MATLABSNLO\code).

How to uninstall

If you've installed mlSNLO as a MATLAB App, switch to the 'APPS' tab in the MATLAB, right click the 'mlSNLO' button and select 'Uninstall'.

If you've chosen to not install mlSNLO as a MATLAB App, delete the files extracted from the .zip file.

Troubleshooting and error reporting

I try to thoroughly test all the software before I deliver it but sometimes I miss problems. 
If you encounter anything you suspect to be erroneous, please let me know so I can fix it.

Please send errors, questions or comments to arlee.smith@as-photonics.com or jesse.smith@as-photonics.com.
