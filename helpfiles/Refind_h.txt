Ref.Ind. computes the refractive indexes, group velocities, group delay dispersions, and birefringent walkoff angles for uniaxial or biaxial crystals with any specified propagation direction. This function is useful if you wish to manually calculate phase matching or group velocities for situations not covered by SNLO functions Qmix, Bmix, QPM, Opoangles, Ncpm, or GVM.

You specify the crystal, the temperature, the wavelength, and the propagation direction. The propagation direction is specified by theta and phi where theta is the polar angle measured from the z- axis and phi is the azimuthal angle measured from the x-axis toward the y-axis.

The calculated angle delta for biaxial crystals is the polarization angle for the eigen polarization with hi refractive index. The angle is measured from the k-z plane in the clockwise direction as viewed along the propagation vector.

Walkoff is always toward the direction that would lower the refractive index at the highest rate. For negative uniaxial crystals the e wave walks toward theta = 90, while for positive uniaxial crystals it walks toward theta = 0. The axis system I use for biaxial crystals makes the refractive indexes satisfy n_x<n_y<n_z. In biaxial crystals walkoff is along the same direction as the polarization. For the eigenpolarization associated with the hi refractive index, walkoff is in the plane defined by angle delta, while for the low index eigenpolarization walkoff is in the orthogonal direction.

For more information on the individual crystals you can run function QMIX. In QMIX, selecting a crystal will display basic information about that crystal.
