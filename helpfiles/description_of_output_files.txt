For standalone versions of mlSNLO, in Windows these files will be saved to a directory in your 
AppData folder. To access it, you can use a the address '%appdata%\MATLAB SNLO'; this can be used in
either the run dialog which appears when you hit Win+R keys, or in the location box of a File 
Explorer window.

For MATLAB App versions of these files, they should be saved into MATLAB's current working directory.

--2D_mix-LP--
	Ascii (text) data files:
		'mix_2d_lp_red1_data.dat', 'mix_2d_lp_red2_data.dat', 'mix_2d_lp_blue_data.dat' are saved after each run, and each has a text header describing its contents. Each file contains the values for each wave:
		(red1) time [s], power [W], phase [rad], M-squared (crystal output face) in x, tilt (crystal output face) [urad] in x, radius of curvature (crystal output face) in x [mm], w_x (crystal output face) [um],
		M-squared (crystal output face) in y, tilt (crystal output face) [urad] in y, radius of curvature (crystal output face) in y [mm], w_y (crystal output face) [um])

	Because writing and reading large text files is slow, 2D mix LP also saves some data in MATLAB .mat binary files.

	Binary data .mat files:

		For cw cases a file 'mix_2d_lp_cw_data.mat' is saved. It contains a data structure with fieldnames which correspond to the quantity it contains. The cw data structure contains these fields:
			'field_blue', 'field_red1', and 'field_red2' are nx * ny arrays containing electric fields for the three waves. 
			'inputs' is a record of the input values used to generate the data file. Inputs is itself a data structure whose fieldnames describe parameters read from the input form
			'phase_vs_z' is an array of size nz * 3  and is a record of the heterodyne phase of each field at each z slice (xy plane) in the crystal (constructed by taking the phase angle of the 2D electric field summed in x and y dimensions).
			'power_vs_z' is an array of size nz * 3, and is record of the power of each wave at each z slice (xy plane) in the crystal.
			'xgrid', 'ygrid', and 'zvec' are vectors of positions. Their length is nx, ny, and nz respectively, and their values range between 0 and the crystal length in x, y, or z direction.
			'xgridmat', 'ygridmat' are two-dimensional meshgrid arrays which are replicated from xgrid and ygrid so they have size nx * ny, where xgridmat changes in the first dimension but is constant in the second, and ygridmat is constant in the first dimension but changes in the second.
			'xyz_beam_inputs' is a data structure containing fields 'red1', 'red2', and 'blue', which are each data structures themselves which contain data sent to the M-squared calculator internal function. Fields for each of these are step sizes 'dx' and 'dy', spatial meshgrids 'xgridmat' and 'ygridmat', wavelength 'lambda', # nz points 'x', refractive index 'n', and z positions vector 'z'
			'xyz_beam_qual' is a data structure returned by the M-squared calculator containing fields 'red1', 'red2', and 'blue', which are each data structures themselves. Fields for each contain values of msquared in x&y at each z point (xy plane) in the crystal 'msquaredxy', curvature (radius of, and waves of) 'radiusOfCurvature' and 'wavesOfCurvature', estimated 1/e^2 radius at waist squared 'w0squared', 1/e^2 radius squared 'wxysquared', centroids 'xy_bar', tilts 'tilts', and a quantity used by the M-squared calculator 'A_x_y'.
			'xyt_beam_inputs' are similar to xyz_beam_inputs but contain only fields (steady-state) at crystal output face 
			'xyt_beam_qual' are results from M-squared calculator found using xyt_beam_inputs
		For pulsed cases, a file 'mix_2d_lp_movie.mat' is saved contains quantities similar to those above. The fieldnames of the data structure written to file are:
			field_red1_xyt, field_red2_xyt, field_blue_xyt,
			xgrid, ygrid are vectors of positions in x and y (in meters). Length nx & ny, respectively.
			xgrid_display, ygrid_display are also position vectors. If nx>64, xgrid_display has 64 points; if ny>64, ygrid_display has 64 points.
			xgridmat, ygridmat
			tvec
			zvec
			field_red1_xyt_crystaloutput, field_red2_xyt_crystaloutput, and field_blue_xyt_crystaloutput are
			red1_pulse_m2_output, red2_pulse_m2_output, and blue_pulse_m2_output
			xyt_beam_qual
		
		
	For quantities such as power_vs_z, which is an nz * 3 array, the first dimension corresponds to z-slices (xy planes) the electric field values are defined on, and the second dimension is which wave, ordered as RED1, RED2, and BLUE. The vector zvec provides the z position for each plane.
