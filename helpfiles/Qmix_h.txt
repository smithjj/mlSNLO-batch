QMIX helps you quickly select the best crystal for your application     
from a list of over 60 crystals.  It calculates all the possible        
phase-matching orientations for the chosen crystal at the wavelengths   
specified, returning phase-matching angles, polarizations, refractive   
indexes, group velocities, group delay dispersion, effective            
nonlinearity, crystal tilt tolerance, acceptance angles, acceptance     
bandwidths, and acceptance temperatures. The three beams are assumed    
to have collinear propagation vectors. If the nonlinearity, deff,       
is zero, the other properties are not calculated. (If you want to       
find noncritical wavelengths, use function Ncpm.)                       
                                                                        
When a crystal is selected from the crystal list its transmission       
data (if available) is displayed in the plot and also written to the    
ascii file CRYST_TR.DAT. Other properties are listed in the output      
window. They can be printed using the Print button.                     
                                                                        
The values of d_eff for type 1 or type 2 mixing in uniaxial crystals    
are for crystals cut for the value of phi that maximizes d_eff.         
The value of phi can be determined from the form of the expressions     
for d_eff for (1 e wave) or (2 e waves) shown in the Qmix window        
when you select a uniaxial crystal.                                     
                                                                        
For biaxial crystals, propagation is in one of the principal            
planes.  When you choose a biaxial crystal the Principal Plane selector 
is activated. Select the plane of interest. I use the axis system       
in which the refractive indexes obey n_x<n_y<n_z. Be aware that         
this is not a universal convention. To calculate phase matching etc.    
for propagation that is not in a principal plane use the function BMIX. 
                                                                        
Acceptance bandwidths, angles, and temperatures are ranges over         
which (L delta k) varies from -pi to pi.  This is 13% greater than      
the full width at half maximum for the sinc^2(delta k L/2) function     
that describes weak mixing conversion efficiency.                       
                                                                        
The OPO acceptance bandwidth (abbreviated 'OPO accpt bw' and activated   
by selecting Type OPO) is that for the red1 and red2 waves, assuming    
the blue (pump) wavelength is fixed. That is, I assume that the red     
waves tune by equal amounts in opposite directions. The Mix acceptance  
bandwidths (activated by selecting Type Mix) are those of the red1      
and red2 waves.  The left number is associated with the first wavelength
on the first line of the output, the right number is associated with    
the second wavelength. I assume in calculating each bandwidth that      
the other red wavelength is fixed, so the blue wave tunes by the same   
amount as the specified wave.                                           
                                                                        
The OPO acceptance bandwidth in cm-1 for a one cm long crystal is       
given by 1/(gvi_1 - gvi_2).  The Mix acceptance bandwidths are given    
by 1/(gvi_3 - gvi_1) and 1/(gvi_3 - gvi_2) where gvi_x is the x wave    
group velocity index, related to group velocity by:                     
group velocity = c/gvi_x and x=1 is red1, x=2 is red2, x=3 is blue      
wave.                                                                   
                                                                        
Group delay dispersion (GDD) is the change in group delay with          
change in wavelength. I use units of fs^2/mm to conform with            
common usage. To convert between GVD in cm/sec-cm^-1 and GDD in         
fs^2/mm use GDD=-5.89E-4 GVD gvi^2                                      
                                                                        
The OPO acceptance angles (abbreviated 'OPO accpt ang' and activated     
by selecting Type OPO) are those for the red1 and red2 waves            
assuming the blue wave is a plane wave at a fixed propagation angle.    
Thus the red waves must tilt in opposite directions so the transverse   
components of their k-vectors are equal and opposite.  The Mix          
acceptance angles (activated by selecting Type Mix) are those of the    
red1 and red2 wavelengths.  Each is calculated assuming the other       
is a plane wave of fixed angle so the specified wave and the blue       
must tilt in the same direction such that their transverse k-vector     
components are equal. The angles are internal to the crystal.           
                                                                        
The OPO red1 acceptance angle in mrad for a one cm long crystal         
is given by (0.1)(lamda_1)/n_1(wo_1 - wo_2) where n_1 is the red1       
refractive index, wo_1 is the red1 walk off in mrad, wo_2 is the        
red2 walkoff angle in mrad, and lamda_1 is the red1 wavelength          
in nm.  To find the red2 acceptance angle, exchange red1 and red2       
in this expression.  The Mix acceptance angle in mrad for a      
one cm long crystal is given by (0.1)(lamda_1)/n_1(wo_1 - wo_3).        
To find the red2 acceptance angle exchange red1 and red2 in             
this expression.  Higher order effects become important for angle       
noncritical mixing, but they are not included in these acceptance       
angles. The angles are internal to the crystal.                         
                                                                        
Crystal angular tolerance indicates the amount of crystal tilt          
away from the phase-matching direction that makes (delta k L = 2 pi).   
The individual beams are at fixed angles. The angle is internal to      
the crystal. Other folks sometimes call this the acceptance angle.      
                                                                        
The S_o listed in the Qmix output is a reference irradiance defined     
by S_o=(epsilon_o c lambda_1 lambda_2 n_1 n_2 n_3)/(8 pi^2 deff^2 L^2). 
Divide the (S_o ’ L^2) value listed in Qmix by the square of your 
crystal length in cm to find S_o in W/cm^2. The single-pass, phase
matched, optical parametric field gain of the two red waves is
(gamma L) = sqrt(S_3/S_o), where S_3 is the blue (pump) 
irradiance in W/cm^2.                      
                                                                        
The values of deff listed are wavelength scaled (usually from those     
for doubling 1064 nm light). The wavelength scaling is based on         
Miller's rule, so it is only approximate.  According to Miller's rule   
the value of deff is weakly wavelength dependent and is reduced at      
redder wavelengths. The deff values also include the correction due     
to the walk off angles. That is, the theta in expressions for d_eff     
are replaced by (theta+rho) where rho is the walk off angle.            
                                                                        
The last-used QMIX input values are saved in the file mix.mat.           
If you would like to save those settings for later recall,              
copy (do not simply rename) mix.mat to another file name to store.       
Copy the file back to mix.mat to restore the settings.
