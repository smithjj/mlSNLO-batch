mlSNLO is written and maintained by Arlee and Jesse Smith at 
AS-Photonics in Albuquerque, New Mexico.  It is a translation 
and enhancement of the free version of SNLO available at:

For a quick introduction to SNLO read the file SNLO_Introduction.PDF 
that is in your SNLO folder, and also available on our website at

Other crystal information is available in the 100+ page bibliography 
crystals.pdf which can be downloaded from http://as-photonics.com/snlo_files/Crystals.pdf 
and from the file http://as-photonics.com/snlo_files/beta_n2.pdf
which includes tables of reported two-photon absorption cross sections
and nonlinear refractive index coefficients. Detailed discussions of 
crystal nonlinear optics and the SNLO examples are presented in 
the book "Crystal Nonlinear Optics: with SNLO examples" advertised 
on the SNLO download page.                                

Most of the SNLO functions can be called from a MATLAB script
which lets users automate parametric studies. Examples include
cavity length tuning in the PW-OPO-SP model, or temperature
tuning the phasematch curves in the QPM model. Example scripts
are supplied for each of the functions that can be called from
a script. These are files with the name "test_calling_*.m"
and they are located in the mlSNLO directory. If mlSNLO has 
been installed as a MATLAB App, this directory is 
"%userprofile%\Documents\MATLAB\Add-Ons\Apps\mlSNLO\code"
in recent versions of Windows. If the mlSNLO installation
directory is in your MATLAB path, you can access the file from 
the MATLAB commandline by typing in "test_calling_"
pressing the tab key, which provides a list of the example 
scripts. Highlighting the desired script using the arrow keys or 
the mouse, and pressing enter to select it completes the command 
necessary to run the script. Pressing enter again runs the 
script. To edit the script, just add the prefix "edit " before 
the name of the script and press enter. This opens the script 
file in the MATLAB editor.

Do-it-yourself crystals ZZ_U (uniaxial) and ZZ_B (biaxial) can
be used by editing the files ZZ_U.TXT and ZZ_B.TXT to enter
the Sellmeier equations and the d-tensor. These text files 
contain further instruction. If you're running mlSNLO under 
MATLAB (not the standalone compiled version), these files can
be edited by typing "edit ZZ_U.TXT" or "edit ZZ_B.TXT" from the
MATLAB commandline. In the standalone compiled version, 
the files are located in the "%appdata%\MATLAB SNLO" directory
in Windows, or "~/Library/MATLAB_SNLO" in Mac OSX.
